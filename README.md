# Submarine Project
This repository contains all of the Solidworks models for our MECH 202 Submarine project. Due to some minor issues with OneDrive I'm going to use this up until the entire model is done,
at that point I'll upload the completed project to OneDrive. Hope you remember GitHub from MECH 105.
